# Classic-CV
This is a pure html page where CV is prepared in classic format.
Famous people around the world still have their personal websites in such format. So,this trend never get old.
Tried making a similar copy of the sites of....

Professor Thomas H. Cormen's Personal Site (co-author of Introduction to Algorithms)
https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/
Professor John Kleinberg's Personal Site (developed the HITS algorithm for web search)
http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/
Professor Emeritus Donald Knuth's Personal Site (author of the Art of Computer Programming)
https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/
